## Scoping

This file contains some information on the scoping process.

Scoping is the first step to take when you begin a machine learning project.
Doing a good job scoping the project can allow the project to run smoothly and avoid delays due to unforeseen circumstances.
How can we plan ahead?

#### Problem Statement

You should understand the problem you are trying to solve. What benefit does it have for your company for example? Better customer service? More sales? Faster turnaround times? Once you know what the problem is in simple terms you can better focus on the solution.

#### Data Needs

What predictive signal do you need to create a good solution? Satellite imagery showing deforestation for a computer vision model? What metadata?

#### Proof of Concept

Create a small scale solution that is ad-hoc to determine the feasibility of the project.

#### Resources

Once you know the project is feasible, determine what resources are needed and for how long. Create a timeline for the project with milestones in project management software such as Jira.

#### Metrics 

What will success look like? Decide on what metrics will be used to determine success, often you will need to make a compromise between machine learning (precision, f1) and business metrics (click-through, sales).

#### Risk

Give some thought to what risks there are in training our model, will it be used in a setting that can negatively impact people? What consequences will a biased model bring?
